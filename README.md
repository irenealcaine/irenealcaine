## About me

Technically I am an **engineer**, but a few years ago I discovered that the world of **programming is much more interesting to me.**

I did a frontend bootcamp when I didn't know anything about programming where I saw the essentials, ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-black?logo=HTML5), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-black?logo=css3) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-black?logo=javascript) in addition to ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-black?logo=git), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-black?logo=npm) and other things. In the bootcamp my group and I did a project where we tested our skills using ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-black?logo=vue.js), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-black?logo=firebase), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-black?logo=sass) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify-black?logo=netlify), while developing teamwork and working through the agile methodology. After that, I have been studying more tools from the frontend world, like ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-black?logo=react) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind-black?logo=tailwindcss).

Since then I am continually practicing my knowledge by working on different projects and experiments that I almost always upload to my personal website, [irenealcainealvarez.es](https://irenealcainealvarez.es/). I really like learning ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-black?logo=react) and I am always doing the odd project to complete my portfolio, hoping to be able to work professionally sooner rather than later in this profession that I like so much.
