## About me

Technically I am an engineer, but I discovered recently programming world is much more interesting to me.

I did a frontend bootcamp when I didn't know anything about programming where I saw the essentials, HTML, CSS and JS in addition to Vue, Git, NPM and other things. In the bootcamp my group and I did a project called www.amigaria.com where we tested our skills using Vue3, Firebase and Netlify, while developing teamwork and working through the agile methodology. After that, I have been studying more tools from the frontend world, like React and Tailwind.

I am currently practicing my knowledge working on my personal web, www.irenealcainealvarez.es, using React and Tailwind and doing some other project to complete my portfolio, hoping to work professionally sooner rather than later in this profession that I like so much.
