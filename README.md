# Hi! 👋

## About me

Technically I am an **engineer**, but a few years ago I discovered that the world of **programming is much more interesting to me.**

I did a frontend bootcamp when I didn't know anything about programming where I saw the essentials, ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-black?logo=HTML5), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-black?logo=css3) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-black?logo=javascript) in addition to ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-black?logo=git), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-black?logo=npm) and other things. In the bootcamp my group and I did a project where we tested our skills using ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-black?logo=vue.js), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-black?logo=firebase), ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-black?logo=sass) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify-black?logo=netlify), while developing teamwork and working through the agile methodology. After that, I have been studying more tools from the frontend world, like ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-black?logo=react) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind-black?logo=tailwindcss).

Nowadays, I have been working for over a year as a programmer in a consulting company, facing new challenges every day and continuously learning. In my role, I work with different programming languages and technologies, collaborate in professional environments, and take part in deployment and production release processes, gaining a solid understanding of how projects move from development to production.

Alongside my professional work, I keep practicing and experimenting by developing personal projects, which I usually upload to my personal website, [irenealcainealvarez.es](https://irenealcainealvarez.es/). I really enjoy working with ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-black?logo=react) and continuing to expand my skills while building and refining my portfolio.
